## Mintbean Hackathon- Stock Market Simulator

This was my first hackathon that I have participated. Requirement was to create a trading platform where a user can buy/sell stocks with price that contiunously fluctuate to mimic real stock market in 6 days as per instruction here: https://sites.google.com/mintbean.io/2020-10-07-stock-market-sim/home
I used this opportunity to further enhance my React/Redux skill and experiment with different technologies to solve specific problem. Looking forward to compete in more hackathons.
